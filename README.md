## Product Description

**WickedWhims** is the NSFW powerhouse that turns Sims into fully animated adults. Under the hood it swaps out the blur, adds detailed bodies, piles on romance perks, and integrates menstrual cycles, attractiveness scores, and birth control for ultra-real gameplay. Pair it with **Basemental** for functional vices—think gambling tables, party substances, and a real criminal career path that finally pays. Sprinkle in Passion for quick casual hookups or WonderfulWhims if you want the flirty systems minus explicit scenes. The result: a living world where clubs, affairs, and adult jobs feel organic instead of bolt-on cut-scenes.

## Installation Instructions 🚀

1. **Snag** the WickedWhims zip from its site repository.
2. **Extract** only the `WickedWhimsMod` folder—don’t dump the whole zip.
3. Drop that folder inside `Documents > Electronic Arts > The Sims 4 > Mods`.
4. Fire up the game, open *Game Options → Other*, tick **Enable Custom Content and Script Mods**, hit Apply, restart.
5. On first load a pop-up confirms scripts are live; look for the purple heart icon in Build/Buy.
6. For extensions (Basemental, Passion, add-on animations) repeat steps 1-4—keep each pack in its own folder inside *Mods*.
7. Back in game, open WooHoo settings from the heart icon, flick switches for nudity, autonomy, pregnancy risk, etc., and play.

*Tip:* Sort CC with an external mod manager to dodge duplicate files and random crashes.

## Pro Tricks & Safety Net 🛡️

* 🌡️ **Tune Autonomy:** If townsfolk keep stripping in the gym, lower global nudity chance in settings.
* 🍼 **Pregnancy Odds:** Fertility sliders let you craft rare surprise babies or sitcom-level chaos.
* 🔞 **Age Gates:** WickedWhims auto-locks features to teen+ Sims; nothing underage is ever shown.
* ☁️ **Backup Saves:** Adult mods flag your save; copy it before updates so you can roll back if a patch breaks scripts.
* 🛠️ **Patch Day Ritual:** Remove mods, let the new update install, then re-add once the modder drops a hotfix (usually fast thanks to active support).
